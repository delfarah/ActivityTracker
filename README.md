# ActivityTracker
A simple program that can monitor your activity that I plan to extend over time.
It is tested on Ubuntu 17.10 on Xorg


Usage:

1. To start tracking:
  run track.sh or add it to startup and it will run automatically on every reboot

2. To see the report:
  python2.7 report.py THE_DATE #e.g. 2018-01-21




The plan:
It only counts the seconds and reports accordingly, not very realistic - can improve
Not yet sensitive to program title (Name of Chrome page title can be useful)
More extensive reports
